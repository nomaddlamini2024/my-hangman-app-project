# **Hangman Game - React App**

Welcome to the **Hangman Game**, a fun word-guessing game built 
using **React**! Players attempt to guess a randomly chosen word 
by selecting letters one by one. Too many incorrect guesses result 
in losing the game (and the hangman being completed).

## **Game Rules**
1. A random word is selected by the app when the game begins.
2. Players guess the word letter-by-letter by clicking the on-screen 
   keyboard.
3. If a guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
4. If a guessed letter is incorrect, one step of the hangman drawing 
   will appear.
5. The player has **10 attempts** to guess the word correctly before 
   losing.
6. The game ends when:
    - The player guesses all the letters correctly (they **win**).
    - The player runs out of attempts (they **lose**).
7. The player can click the **Restart Game** button anytime to reset 
   the game.
